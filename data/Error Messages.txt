GraphEasy could not parse your equation, try adding parenthesis?
There's something wrong with your equation...
I didn't feel too good about that equation...
Error: The answer you seek is not in this equation
Error: The equation you entered is like a bad joke, it's not funny
Error: This equation is more complex than a labyrinth
Error: I'm not sure what you're trying to do, but it's not working
Error: Function overload, please try again later
Error: Math is hard, let's go shopping
Error: Not even close, keep trying
Error: Not a function, more like a failure
Error: Does not compute... or does it?
Error: Equation gone wrong, please try again
That's not how math works, I'm afraid
I'm sorry, I can't make sense of that
Looks like someone's trying to break me!
I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish with that equation
I think you may have forgotten to add a number there
I'm afraid I can't plot that, it's beyond my capabilities
Please check your parentheses, they seem to be confused
I'm pretty sure that's not how you spell calculus
I think you meant to divide, not multiply
Looks like someone needs to go back to math class
