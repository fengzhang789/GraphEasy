A GUIDE ON USING GraphEasy

There are a few things to note before fully graphing equations using GraphEasy.
ALLOWABLE INPUTS:

1. Coefficients without the multiplication sign are not supported! 
For example, -7x and 9x should be written as -7*x, and 9*x. 

2. Negative signs outside brackets are not supported!
For example, -(x+1) must be written as -1*(x+1)

3. GraphEasy fully follows BEDMAS! If your equation is not what you expected, 
check to see if you used parenthesis where needed. 

4. To divide two composite functions, brackets are needed on either side of the
division symbol. For example, (x^2)/(x^3+1)

5. Logarithms are not supported in this version!

6. sin, cos, tan, sqrt, and the constant e is supported. Any basic math operation
including multiplication, division, exponents, addition and subtraction are supported.


a small tip...
If the graph doesn't work, try adding some more brackets, or changing a negative
sign to -1 multiplied by the same number.
